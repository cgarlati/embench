# Embench Context Switch and Interrupt Benchmark

The work of this project is now transferred to the
[embench-rt](https://github.com/embench/embench-rt) repository.  Embench
benchmarks are now named for the market sector they address, rather than the
technology they are based on.

Although all files were removed from this repository in its final commit, the
history is preserved both in this repository and (more usefully) in the the
[embench-rt](https://github.com/embench/embench-rt) repository.

This benchmark is now archived.
