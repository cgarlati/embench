# Embench Context Switch and Interrupt Benchmark

Micro-benchmark for embedded systems to characterize their behavior in respect
of context switching speed and interrupt latency.

This work is led by Cesare Garlati (@cgarlati).

Hex Five's test cases for eventualy inclusion in David Patterson's Embench
project https://github.com/embench
